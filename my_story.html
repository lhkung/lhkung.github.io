    <p class="story">Why leave behind a thriving career in translation and interpretation to study computer science? I was often asked this question when I told my colleagues that I am going to study computer science at Upenn. Indeed, I was a Chinese-English translator and interpreter by trade, and I will never forget the grueling training I went through to become one. But I am also a man of aspirations, with an appetite for novel challenges and opportunities out there. As IT-related texts and conferences became a steady stream for my workload over the past three years of my professional practice, a vision gradually developed in my mind –– a vision to integrate my expertise in translation with the endless potentials of computer science, driven by an insatiable desire to push the boundaries of personal growth and those of the translation community in Taiwan. </p>
    <p class="story">Yes, my undergraduate education, pursued at a top liberal arts college in Taiwan, is one steeped in humanities and language. From William Shakespeare’s tragedies to Immanuel Kant’s ethics, from Universal Grammar to how different languages deal with morphemes, I was educated to be a bridge between Taiwan’s culture and that of the West, a communicator who knows well the cultures he communicates between as well as the medium he communicates with. As an English major, I took classes not only in literature, culture, and philosophy but also in linguistics, including introduction to linguistics, phonetics, sociolinguistics, grammar and rhetoric, and English philology. This education shaped my open-minded worldview and molded me into the endeavoring man I am today.</p>
    <p class="story">Upon completing one-year obligatory military service, I chose to reinforce my ability to communicate between languages and cultures by pursuing a master’s degree in translation and interpretation at National Taiwan Normal University, with a focus on Chinese-English conference interpreting. Considered one of the most selective and rigorous interpreter training program in the region, if not the world, the program equipped me with the ability to perform consecutive and simultaneous interpreting at the same level seen in UN meetings. I passed a very selective professional exam in 2018 and became a full-fledged interpreter and translator in Taiwan, although my master’s thesis wasn’t completed until 2020, when COVID-19 gave me a break from work.</p>
    <p class="story">I began my career as a freelance Chinese-English interpreter and translator at a time when major breakthroughs were made in deep learning and Google’s switch from statistical machine translation to neural machine translation was bearing fruit. It has been an exciting career. I interpreted for politicians seen on TV, important conferences attended by the president, and technical meetings on the latest technological innovation. However, I never was a man complacent with the status quo. As cases from the IT industry, including those about IoT, AI, 5G, edge computing, and cloud computing, came to constitute a significant bulk of my workload, I became not only more interested in but also more knowledgeable about its opportunities. Slowly emerging is a vision to integrate my expertise in language communication with the potentials of computer science. </p>
    <p class="story">My vision was furnished with a specific direction when I was commissioned to translate tech journalist James Vlahos’s Talk to Me: How Voice Computing Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Think, a book that introduced me to important concepts in the field of natural language processing, especially neural network translation. NLP captured my imagination. My emerging interest in NLP was further enhanced by an interesting episode that occurred in my professional practice. In 2018, I interpreted for a peculiar conference where the organizer, in addition to hiring human simultaneous interpreters, employed Microsoft’s AI-powered automatic translation technology to produce live English subtitles for the Chinese speech that took place on stage. To my amusement, the machine translation turned out to be so incomprehensible that the host eventually decided to feed my output into Microsoft’s speech recognition application, which finally produced fluent and intelligible English subtitles. While I was glad I defeated machine that day, I was deeply inspired by the intersection of human language and computation.</p>
    <p class="story">I began to imagine: what if I can tap into its opportunity? What if I can develop a powerful tool for my fellow translators based on parallel texts and n-gram query? What if I can contribute to the development of machine translation? While the prospects of high quality machine translation are widely dismissed, if not derided, by my fellow translators, I believe the technology can not only assist translators in translating better but also democratize access to translation, providing information across language barriers in occasions where human practitioners are not economically viable. I want to be part of this thriving field of research. Just as I communicate between languages, I want to be the link that connects expertise from translation to that from computer science. With this goal in mind, I became determined to pursue a second master degree –– this time in computer science.</p>
